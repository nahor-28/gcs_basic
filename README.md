# Technical Documentation: ArduPilot Ground Control Station (GCS) Basic

## Overview

This is a lightweight Ground Control Station (GCS) application designed to interface with ArduPilot autopilots. The application provides real-time telemetry visualization and basic vehicle control capabilities through a simple Tkinter-based GUI.

## Architecture

The application follows an event-driven architecture using a publish-subscribe pattern, with the following main components:

### 1. Core Components

- **main.py**: The entry point that initializes the system and manages the main event loop
- **core/telemetry_manager.py**: Handles MAVLink communication and telemetry processing
- **ui/simple_display.py**: Tkinter-based GUI for displaying telemetry data
- **utils/event_bus.py**: Implements the event bus for inter-component communication

### 2. Key Features Implemented

- **MAVLink Protocol Support**: Communicates with ArduPilot using pymavlink
- **Real-time Telemetry Display**: Shows various vehicle parameters including:
    - Position (Latitude, Longitude, Altitude)
    - Attitude (Roll, Pitch, Yaw)
    - GPS Status
    - Battery Information
    - Vehicle Status (Arming state, Mode)
- **Event-Driven Architecture**: Uses a custom event bus for loose coupling between components
- **Thread-Safe Operations**: Implements proper thread synchronization for GUI updates

### 3. Technical Implementation Details

- **Event Bus**: Centralized communication system that allows components to communicate without direct dependencies
- **Threading**: Uses Python's threading module for concurrent operations (telemetry processing and UI updates)
- **Logging**: Comprehensive logging for debugging and monitoring

## Current Status

The application currently provides:

- Basic telemetry visualization
- Connection management
- Status message display
- Thread-safe UI updates
- Event-based architecture for extensibility

- [ ] Implement data compression for reduced bandwidth usage
- [ ] Add support for different telemetry update rates

## Dependencies

- Python 3.x
- pymavlink
- tkinter
- Standard Python libraries (threading, queue, logging, etc.)

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies: 
    
    ```
    pip install pymavlink
    ```
    
2. Connect your autopilot
3. Run: 
    
    ```
    python main.py
    ```
    

## Known Issues

- Limited error recovery for connection drops
- Basic UI with limited customization options
- No data persistence for telemetry logs

This documentation provides a comprehensive overview of the current implementation and outlines potential directions for future development. The event-driven architecture provides a solid foundation for extending functionality while maintaining good separation of concerns.
