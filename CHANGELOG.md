  - StatusController for status message handling  
  - BaseController abstract class for consistent controller patterns
- **Signal Management System**:
  - Centralized SignalManager for all inter-component communication
  - Thread-safe signal routing between all MVC components
  - Specific signals for different data types (attitude, position, GPS, status)

### Added - Core Infrastructure ‚úÖ  
- **Threading Architecture**:
  - TelemetryThread for dedicated MAVLink message reception
  - Thread-safe UI updates via Qt signals
  - Heartbeat monitoring with automatic reconnection
- **Connection Management**:

  - Exponential backoff reconnection strategy
  - Support for both UDP and serial connections
  - Automatic port detection and configuration
- **Telemetry Processing**:
  - Comprehensive MAVLink message parsing
  - Message filtering for performance optimization
  - Real-time data validation and error handling
  - Configurable update frequencies for different message types

### Added - User Interface ‚úÖ
- **Professional Layout Design**:
  - Modern PySide6-based responsive interface
  - Resizable splitter panels for optimal space usage
  - Light theme with Fusion style
  - Proper application lifecycle management
- **Telemetry Display Components**:
  - Attitude display (roll, pitch, yaw, heading) with degree formatting
  - Position display (latitude, longitude, altitude MSL/AGL) with precision formatting
  - Speed information (ground speed, air speed, climb rate)
  - Battery status (voltage, current, remaining percentage) with proper units
  - GPS information display (fix type, satellite count)
- **Status and Control Systems**:
  - Real-time connection status with detailed messages
  - Comprehensive status message system with severity levels
  - Connection management interface with parameter configuration
  - Error reporting and user feedback systems

### Changed - Architecture Migration
- **From Event Bus to Signal/Slot**: Migrated from custom event bus to Qt's native signal/slot mechanism
- **Component Decoupling**: All components now communicate exclusively through SignalManager
- **Thread Safety**: Enhanced thread safety with proper signal routing patterns
- **Code Organization**: Restructured project into clear MVC directories and modules
- **Data Flow**: Implemented clean data flow: TelemetryManager ‚Üí VehicleController ‚Üí VehicleModel ‚Üí Views

### Temporarily Removed - For Refactoring
- **Vehicle Control Features**: Arm/disarm functionality (to be re-implemented in Phase 1b)
- **Mode Change Operations**: Flight mode switching (to be re-implemented with proper signal flow)
- **RC Channel Display**: Radio control channel visualization (removed during MVC migration)
- **Direct Signal Connections**: Replaced all direct connections with MVC pattern

### Fixed - Architecture & Stability ‚úÖ
- **Signal Flow Architecture**: Proper signal routing through centralized SignalManager
- **Thread Safety Issues**: All UI updates now properly routed through main thread
- **Connection State Handling**: Robust connection status management and display
- **Memory Management**: Proper cleanup and resource management in threading
