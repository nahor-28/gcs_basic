## ðŸŸ¡ Current Development Focus

### Feature Implementation Ready
**Status**: Ready for confident implementation  
**Impact**: High - Can now implement user-facing features on proven foundation with working vehicle control

#### Ready to Implement - High Priority
With the architecture now fully verified and arm & takeoff proven working, these features are ready for implementation:
1. **Flight Mode Display/Control**: Signal system verified, ready for implementation using proven patterns
2. **Disarm Functionality**: Complement existing arm & takeoff using same infrastructure
3. **Enhanced Vehicle Commands**: Communication chain confirmed working with live testing
4. **Enhanced Map Integration**: Position data flow verified working with live data
5. **Mission Planning Interface**: Build on proven command infrastructure

#### Implementation Approach
- Use verified signal patterns from working telemetry and arm & takeoff systems
- Follow established MVC patterns that are proven functional
- Build on confirmed working SignalManager communication system
- Leverage existing MAVLink command infrastructure from arm & takeoff feature
- Use proven safety validation patterns for new vehicle commands

## ðŸŸ¡ Medium Priority Issues

### Feature Completeness
**Status**: Architecture ready, features need restoration  
**Impact**: Medium - Missing expected functionality but foundation is solid

#### Features to Restore/Enhance
- **Flight Mode Control Interface**: Framework exists and communication verified, needs UI implementation
- **Enhanced Vehicle Commands**: Basic arm & takeoff proven working, can expand to other commands
- **RC Channel Display**: Removed during MVC refactor, can be cleanly re-added
- **Status Message Enhancements**: Basic system working, could use formatting improvements
- **Map Functionality Enhancement**: Basic placeholder functional, needs actual map rendering
- **Mission Planning**: Build on proven vehicle command infrastructure

### Testing Infrastructure Improvements
**Status**: Basic testing proven working, can be enhanced  
**Impact**: Medium - Development efficiency improvements

#### Testing Enhancements Needed
- **Mock Data Testing**: Would improve development workflow without SITL dependency
- **Automated Test Runner**: Current manual testing works, automation would help
- **Performance Testing**: System stable, but formal performance validation would be useful
- **Integration Test Expansion**: Basic integration proven, more comprehensive tests beneficial

---

## ðŸŸ¢ Low Priority Issues

### UI Polish and User Experience
**Status**: Functional but could be improved  
**Impact**: Low - Usability enhancements

#### Visual Design Improvements
- Basic styling applied and functional, works well
- Dark theme option could be added for user preference
- Customization options are limited but not blocking
- Status messages could use better formatting for clarity

#### User Experience Enhancements
- No tooltips or help text (functionality is clear but could be enhanced)
- Error messages are functional but could be more user-friendly
- Progress indicators for connection attempts would improve UX
- Keyboard shortcuts not implemented but not essential

### Code Quality and Maintenance
**Status**: Architecture excellent, minor improvements possible  
**Impact**: Low - Future development efficiency

#### Documentation
- âœ… Comprehensive logging system in place and proven functional
- âœ… Architecture documentation accurate and up-to-date
- Inline comments could be expanded for complex areas
- API documentation comprehensive enough for current needs

#### Error Handling
- âœ… Critical error cases handled properly in telemetry system
- âœ… UI update methods have robust exception handling
- âœ… Connection error recovery is proven working
- Some edge cases could use additional handling but not critical
